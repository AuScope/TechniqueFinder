# Technique Finder

Technique Finder(TF) application aids to find the techniques and facilities to fit your research project.

Use TF to identify and understand the microscopy and microanalyses techniques available to researchers through Microscopy Australia.
You will find the contact details of expert staff for each technique. They can provide you with all the information you need,
and guide you through the planning, training, data collection and interpretation stages of your experiments.

## Notes:
- Sample data will be loaded to the dev environment by a database dump
- DDL commands for the database can be found here: TechniqueFinder/db/ddl.sql
- Dev environment use TechniqueFinder/DockerFiles/dev-config.php, use TechniqueFinder/application/config/config.php for other environments.
